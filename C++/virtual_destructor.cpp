/* Virtual destructors: 
 * Although C++ provides a default destructor for your classes if you do not provide one yourself, it is sometimes 
 * the case that you will want to provide your own destructor (particularly if the class needs to deallocate memory). 
 * You should always make your destructors virtual if youâ€™re dealing with inheritance.*/
