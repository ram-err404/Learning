/* Quest: Given an Array of non negative Integers and a number. You need to print 
 * all the starting and ending indices of Subarrays having their sum equal to the 
 * given integer.  
 *
 * For Example :- * Input-int[] arr = {2, 3, 6, 4, 9, 0, 11};
 * int num = 9    // sum
 * Output-
 * starting index : 1, Ending index : 2
 * starting index : 5, Ending index : 5
 * starting index : 5, Ending index : 6 */

/* Solution: We can maintain two pointers, start and end pointers which basically represents
 * a subarray and also we have to take a variable which stores the current sum of the
 * subarray starting from start pointer and ending at end pointer.
 *
 *  --> we keep on incrementing end pointer while adding the element in the current sum
 *      until we reach a point where our current running sum is more than required target
 *      sum, this basically means that the current subarray whose sum weâ€™ve calculated is
 *      not the right answer.
 *  --> So now we alter our subarray by moving the start pointer, that is shortening the
 *      subarray and hence the current sum in the hope that we achieve the current sum
 *      equal to the required target sum.
 *  --> At every point we check if our current sum is equal to target sum or not, if this
 *      is the case we print our pointers.
 *  --> So basically we are altering the subarray by increasing start and end pointers and
 *      changing the current sum depending on its value as compared to target sum. */
